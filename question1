Single File Programming Question
Matrix Rotation Using Inheritance



Write a Java program to rotate a matrix n times in both clockwise and anti-clockwise directions using inheritance.



Question Instructions:



Create a base class named Clock.

Extend the Clock class with two subclasses: Clockwise and Anticlockwise.

Both subclasses should contain a method rotate() that performs the respective rotation on the matrix.

Create a driver class named Main to handle input and output operations.

Input format :
The first line contains the number of rows.
The second line contains the number of columns.
The following lines contain the matrix as input rows and columns with space as a separator between each item in the matrix.
Then the following line contains the number of rotations to be performed.
Output format :
Print "Clockwise" followed by the matrix after performing the specified number of clockwise rotations.
Print "Anti clockwise" followed by the matrix after performing the specified number of anti-clockwise rotations.
Code constraints :
0 < Row <=10

0 < Column <=10

0 < Number Of Rotations <=10
