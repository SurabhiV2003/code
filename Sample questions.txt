1.Write a Java program to calculate the area and perimeter of two types of polygons: Square and Triangle.
Define an interface named Polygon with the following methods:
double calculateArea();
double calculatePerimeter();

Create a class Square that implements Polygon:
property- side length.
Area formula = side × side.
Perimeter formula = 4 × side.


Create a class Triangle that implements Polygon:
properties- a,b,c
Perimeter = a + b + c.

Area (using Heron’s Formula):
s = (a + b + c) / 2
Area = √(s × (s – a) × (s – b) × (s – c))

In the main method:

Read inputs for Square side.
Read inputs for Triangle sides.
Display the area and perimeter for both shapes.

Input format:
First line: double → side of square
Next three lines: double values → sides of triangle (a, b, c)

Output format:

Print Square Area and Perimeter.
Print Triangle Area and Perimeter.

Sample Test Case 1:

Input:

5
3
4
5

Output:

Square Area: 25.0
Square Perimeter: 20.0
Triangle Area: 6.0
Triangle Perimeter: 12.0
