Vehicle Interface and Car Implementation



Design a Java program to model vehicles using an interface and a concrete class.



Task:

Define an interface named 'Vehicle' that represents the behaviour of a vehicle.
Create a class named 'Car' that implements the 'Vehicle' interface.


Vehicle: Define an interface representing the behaviour of a vehicle following methods are given below:





Create a class 'Car' with the following attributes and methods:



speed (int): Represents the current speed of the car.
gear (int): Represents the current gear of the car.
brake (int): Represents the brake applied to the car.


Implement the 'Vehicle' interface in the 'Car' class.



Define the method printState() to display the current state of the car, including its speed and gear.



The speed is calculated by subtracting the brake applied from the initial speed. Ensure the speed does not drop below zero.



The gear remains unchanged from the input.

Input format :
The first line of input is an integer representing the speed of the car.
The second line of input is an integer representing the gear of the car.
The third line of input is an integer representing the brake applied to the car.
Output format :
The output should print the current state of the car in the following format:

Car present state:

speed: <calculated_speed> gear: <current_gear>



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
54
3
23
Output 1 :
Car present state:
speed: 31 gear: 3
Input 2 :
60
4
20
Output 2 :
Car present state:
speed: 40 gear: 4
